This program is now deprecated\
During the 2020-2021 School Year, Boston College required students to make reservations to go to the gym, unfortunately these time slots would fill up almost immediately so I created this basic program. It was a web page I deployed on Heroku that listed off all unavailable time slots (obtained through web scraping). The user was able to select a time slot and then enter their phone number to recieve a notification via the twillio sms API when their slot would open up with available positions.
